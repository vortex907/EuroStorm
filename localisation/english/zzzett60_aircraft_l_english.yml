The missile was stored in a hermetically-sealed transport-launch container. The container would be raised to a 16 degree elevation for launch. Two launches of the missile were made from a test center in 1959 and 1960 before the land-based project was cancelled on 5 February 1960. Further developments were eventually fielded as the Rubezh system, or the SSC-3 Styx, land-based anti-ship missile in the 1970s."
