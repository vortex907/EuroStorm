prussia.2.d:0 "The Kaiserliche Treuepartei (KTP) is a monarchist political party that claims to uphold the legal continuity of the German Empire after its collapse. It argues that Germany`s statehood was not abolished but merely interrupted, and that true legitimacy can only be restored through loyalty to the Kaiser and the imperial institution. Rejecting both mass democracy and revolutionary ideologies, the party promotes centralized authority, social hierarchy, and strict civil order. It is primarily supported by former imperial officers, aristocrats, and conservative bureaucrats who view monarchy as a stabilizing framework in an age of political chaos.To its critics, the KTP represents nostalgia and political stagnation; to its supporters, it is the last remaining guardian of legitimacy in a fractured and radicalized Germany."

Rejecting both liberal democracy and traditional conservatism, the party calls for a total counter-revolution against communist rule on the German mainland, aiming to reunify the nation through mass mobilization, discipline, and permanent struggle.
