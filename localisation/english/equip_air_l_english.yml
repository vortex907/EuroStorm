 naval_helicopter_equipment_1_short:"ASW Helo I"
 naval_helicopter_equipment_1_desc:"Anti-Submarine helicopters and their vessels have two advantages over a submarine. Those are speed and standoff. The helicopter can gain an advantage by its speed to search and locate a submarine. Once a submarine has been located the vessel then has the advantage to stand off while the helicopter attacks the submarine. The helicopter is immune to any counter attack from a submarine"
 naval_helicopter_equipment_2:"Naval Helicopter II"
 naval_helicopter_equipment_2_short:"ASW Helo II"
 naval_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:"Anti-submarine helicopters are expensive to build and maintain, and historical encounters between surface vessels and submarines occur mostly when defending convoys. Thus, not every ship should be equipped with anti-submarine helicopters. Helo-equipped hunter-killer ASW carriers and true helo-equipped destroyers are a good balance between the expense and advantages that these vessels offer."
 
 utility_helicopter_equipment:"Utility Helicopter"

 utility_helicopter_equipment_1_short:"Utility Helo I"
 utility_helicopter_equipment_1_desc:"There are seven main types of modern helicopters; attack, transport, observation, utility, maritime, multi-role, and search and rescue helicopters. During WWII the main roles for helicopters were; observation, transport, and search and rescue. The German Focke-Achegelis Fa 330 was towed behind a u-boat and used for observation. Luftwaffe Transportstaffel 40 transported prisoners, and conducted a search and rescue mission for a lost German pilot. The U.S. army sent Sikorsky helicopters to the China-Bruma-India theater for rescue work, search and rescue of downed airmen. US helicopters were also used to transport aircraft parts in the south Pacific."
 utility_helicopter_equipment_2:"Utility Helicopter II"
 utility_helicopter_equipment_2_short:"Utility Helo II"
 utility_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:"During WWII helicopters had little impact on the outcome of the war; however, their development and use continued. The US had six different models in service during the Korean War, and by the Vietnam War the use of helicopters had expanded again. The US 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) deployed helicopters on a large scale. They were used as troop carriers, cargo lift ships, medivacs, and as aerial rocket artillery. This mix of technology and troops allows a division to deploy into combat when and where ever it is needed."

This engine design limited the useful life span of this helicopter because more powerful turboshaft designs were being developed in the 1950’s. Of the 154 Ch-37 that were built the navy took two helicopters. The army and marine corps took the rest. No other nations placed any orders as this design was too expensive to order and operate Four Ch-37’s were deployed to the Vietnam conflict for downed US aircraft recovery."

This was the first turboshaft-powered helicopter that the Soviet Union produced. It was the largest helicopter when it was designed in the mid 1950’s, and it had a maximum load capacity of 12,000Kg. It can transport 65 soldiers, or 41 stretchers with two attendants, or light AVF’s. Over 900 Mi-6 were built (for both military and civil use) from 1959 to 1980, and the Hook was retired from service in 2002."

 FRA_naval_helicopter_equipment_1_desc:"The Alouette II (Lark) Marine was manufactured by Sud Aviation for both military and civilian use. The first flight was 12 Mar 1955, and it’s the first gas turbine-powered helicopter to be manufactured. This light helicopter was in production for almost 20 years and in that time over 1,300 helicopters of all variants were assembled. It’s primary use was for reconnaissance, air-sea rescue, and anti-submarine. In an anti-submarine warfare role it carried acoustic torpedoes. Some Alouette II’s were still being used at the start of the 21st century."

 FRA_naval_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:"The Alouette III Marine (Lark) first flew on 28 February 1959. Production started in 1961 and more than 2,000 helicopters of all variants were manufactured from 1961 until 1985. Over 60 nations used the Lark for military use. The French Navy announced in January 2018 that it would replace its fleet of the Alouette III with the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma."

The first flight was 12 Mar 1955, and it’s the first gas turbine-powered helicopter to be manufactured. It’s primary use was for reconnaissance, anti-tank, and liaison. The helicopter was first used in the Algerian War for the French Army when it entered service. It could carry four fully equipped soldiers, and it is possibly the first helicopter gunship. In an anti-tank role it carried either the SS.10 or SS.11 MCLOS wire-guided anti-tank missile."

 FRA_utility_helicopter_equipment_2_short:"Alouette III" 
 FRA_utility_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:"The Alouette III Lark was developed from the successful Alouette II Lark and it entered service in the very early 1960’s. It was a larger version of the Alouette II, and would become a popular rotorcraft. More than 2,000 of these helicopters were built. It carried out the same roles for military operations as the Alouette II Lark. By 2010 this helicopter was being phased out of service by its operators. The French military was looking forward to replacing them with the newly developed Airbus Helicopter H160."

 FRA_cargo_helicopter_equipment_1_desc:0 "The SA 321 Super Frelon is a three-engine heavy transport helicopter built by Sud Aviation, and its maiden flight was on 7 December 1962. It was used for transport, ASW, SAR, and as a utility transport. The first prototype was customized for the needs of the French Air Force, and the second prototype was modified for the French Navy. It was this second prototype that would be most heavily used by naval air arms; ie, the French Navy and the People’s Liberation Army Naval Air Force. The French Navy would retire the helicopter on 30 April 2010. It was replaced by the Eurocopter EC 225."

 ENG_naval_helicopter_equipment_1_desc:"The Whirlwind HAS.7 was built under licence by Westland Aircraft, and it was a variant of the Sikorsky UH-19 Chickasaw helicopter. Its primary use by the Royal Navy was anti-submarine, and search and rescue. This was the first helicopter that was specifically designed to hunt for submarines. Two helicopters would work together when performing this task. One would be the hunter by deploying sonar while others would be the killers by using either a Mark 30 or Mark 44 torpedo."

The Royal Navy was first to use this helicopter, but later the Royal Air Force and Royal Marines would order variants for their needs as well. Its primary use was for anti-submarine warfare. It was also used for air-sea rescue and as a utility helicopter. The Wessex was introduced in 1961 and its capabilities exceeded that of the Whirlwind. However, two helicopters were still needed for anti-submarine warfare. One would carry a dipping sonar and the other would have either depth charges or torpedoes."

The RN first deployed the HAS.1 in 1961 and the RAF HAR.2 in 1962. The RAF used the Wessex for both search and rescue, and transport. As a search and rescue aircraft it was ideal for flying in mountainous regions. The RAF continued flying the Wessex until 2003 when it was retired from service."
