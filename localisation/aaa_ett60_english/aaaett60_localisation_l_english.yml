It was referred to as the autogyro and it resembled a fixed wing aircraft. This was the first rotary aircraft to have flown successfully. A gyrocopter is unlike a helicopter because the rotors are not powered. Lift occurs when air moves across the blades, thus causing the rotor to spin. Development of the gyrocopter would eventually lead to vertical take off and landings. War time use was mostly for aerial surveillance."

 air_air_missile_1_module_desc:0 "Advances in guided munition technologies have applications for bomber interception. Adding controllable fins to a rocket and a control wire allows a pilot to manually control the flight path of the rocket, allowing far more accurate fire. Since the pilot must use a joystick to control the rocket, the system isn't very effective against enemy fighters, as the pilot would struggle to do two things at once." 

 anti_ship_missile_1_module_desc:0 "The earliest forms of guided munitions came in the form of radio control, using a radio transmitter for control and colored lights affixed to the tail of the device to give orientation, a well trained bombardier could guide the munition to the intended target with decent precision while maintaining a decent amount of stand-off range for the aviator. These early munitions were very susceptible to radio jamming." 
 anti_ship_missile_2_module_desc:0 "Since rocket technology has become reliable enough to be used in a tactical manner, it seems only logical that adding a rocket motor to our guided munitions would be the next step, allowing further range and higher munition speed. This in turn means that the bombardier is able to better direct the munition, thus allowing for better accuracy."

Even during the war the Sturmgewehr (StG) 44 greatly increased the volume of fire when compared to the standard infantry rifle. After the war the StG 45, a wartime Mauser prototype, had a significant influence on post war weapon designs. The main focus was to design an assault rifle which was to be gas-operated, selective fire, and have a 20-round magazine."

The USA, Britain, and the Soviet Union’s weapons development were continuous from wartime to peacetime. The US M-14 rifle comes from improvements made to the M1 Garand. The development of M-16 continues with this process and standardization follows for the Nato countries; ie, 7.62 and 5.56 Nato cartridges. The countries behind the Iron Curtain look to the AK-47, and its variants, as their main battle rifles."

 # USA_anti_air_equipment_desc:0 "The M45 Quadmount, a.k.a. ‘Krautmower’ for its high rate of fire, consisted of four heavy barrel .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns. The turret was designed by the W.L. Maxson Corporation and it replaced the M33 twin mount. It was electrically powered and designed as an anti-aircraft weapon. However, it was also effective against ground targets."

 USA_anti_air_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M1 120mm is a super-heavy AA gun that was used from 1944 to 1960. Its development began after WWI and the prototype was first assembled in 1924. It was considered too heavy and expensive. The need for a super-heavy AA gun was renewed in 1938 and a new prototype was ready by 1940. A battery of guns consisted of four guns, radar, gun director, gun data computer, and the M6 tractor."

 antiair6_desc:0 "Post World War II development of anti-aircraft guns was focused on tracking and directing the AA battery to fire at increasingly faster aircraft. Fire control was improved by the use of  gun directors. Gun directors were used in conjunction with other fire control equipment; such as, height finders and radar."
 #anti_air_equipment_5_desc:0 "Fire control for an anti-aircraft battery can be improved with the use of gun data computers. By adding gun data computers to existing radar and gun directors the AA battery will be correctly pointed at enemy aircraft. Azimuth, elevation and fuze time will now be handle by a complex fire control system."
 anti_air_equipment_6_desc:0 "Fire control for an AA battery can further be improved by combining an individual AA gun with gun laying radar, an analog computer (or director), and an autoloader all onto a single carriage."
 anti_air_equipment_7_desc:0 "Modern anti-aircraft gun development has focused on designing AA guns that are of light calibre (20mm to 30mm) and mobile. Jet aircraft flying at low altitudes, usually under 2.5km, are the primary target for these anti-aircraft guns. Aircraft flying above 2.5km are now the priority target for the newly developed surface-to-air (SAM) missiles."

 # USA_anti_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M5 3-inch Gun began development in late 1940 and it was based on the 3 inch AA gun T9. The initial design was mounted on an M2 howitzer carriage and this was ready by Sept 1941. There were minor problems with this combination and a modified gun carriage called the M6 was used. Production began in Dec 1942 and when deployed it was considered too heavy. It was phased out of service in favour of self-propelled tank destroyers."

 anti_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "War-time improvements to AT guns was necessary due to an increased thickness of tank armour. This in time would result in the development of heavier tanks and even better AT guns. By war's end AT guns would be 85mm and larger. The 128mm Pak 44 was Germany's last war-time AT gun."
 #anti_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "Post war-time AT gun development continued with larger and more powerful AT guns. The Soviet Union made improvements to its 85mm gun with the introduction of the D-48 85mm gun, and the US Army continued with its development of AT recoilless rifles."
 #anti_tank_equipment_6_desc:0 "Improvements to AT capabilities in a post-war era saw the Soviets introduce a larger AT gun - the T-12 100mm Gun. The US Army continued working on recoilless rifles, and the development resulted in deployment of the M40 Recoilless Rifle (105mm rifle with the M8C .50cal spotting rifle attached)."
 anti_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "Post WWII AT missiles were MCLOS (manual controlled line of sight) wire-guided missiles.

There may be light weapons, less than 20mm cannons, that are used for defending the vehicle and crew from enemy attacks, but they do not provide direct fire in support of the battle."
 mechanized_equipment_5_desc:0 "The APC’s that were used during WWII include the American M3 half track, the German Sd. Kfz. 251, and the British Universal Carrier. They evolved from simple armoured cars with transport capacity to purpose built vehicles. The importance of having soldiers accompany tanks into battle became obvious as armies gained the battle field experience that they need in fighting modern wars. Technology was advancing rapidly and this ushered in new weapon systems and tactics."
 #mechanized_equipment_6_desc:0 "The Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) evolved out of the APC, and it was after WWII that these vehicles were deployed by militaries around the world. The French AMX-VCI (Véhicule de Combat d`Infanterie) incorporates many of the characteristics now associated with a modern IVF. Those characteristics are an armoured vehicle that is designed and equipped to transport infantry into battle, with at least a 20mm cannon and sometimes an antitank missile, and provide direct fire in support of the battle."

 antitank_a_desc:0 "The introduction of High-Explosive Squash Head (HESH) or High-Explosive Plastic (HEP) ammunition was somewhat overshadowed by HEAT. However, refinements in the plastic explosive have made HESH and HEP rounds deadly due to improved spalling properties."
 antitank_d:0 "Fin-Stabilised Ammunition"
 antitank_d_desc:0 "With the simple addition of fin stabilisers to the core of our anti-tank rounds, our anti-tank rounds will lose far less speed when travelling to their intended targets, reducing dispersion as well as increasing their penetrative capacity."

# antitank_c_desc:0 "X"
 antitank_b:0 "High-Low Pressure System"
 antitank_b_desc:0 "Utilising the pressure differential between the high pressure gases of ignition and the low pressure of the chamber, we can drastically cut down on equipment and ammunition weight while maintaining the same ballistics as those of a conventional design. This will enable massive upscaling of the calibre of our ammunition, further improving our dedicated anti-tank batteries."
 antitank_e:0 "APFSDS Flechettes"
 antitank_e_desc:0 "An Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot (APFSDS) flechette is a long, narrow, dart-like projectile made of dense materials such as depleted uranium or tungsten, designed to penetrate armored targets at high velocity. It is encased in a sabot that falls away after firing, allowing the fin-stabilized penetrator to continue toward the target with minimal drag and maximum kinetic energy."

 hud_module_desc: "A head-up display, or heads-up display, is a transparent display that presents data without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints, being able to view information with the head positioned "up" and looking forward, instead of angled down looking at lower instruments."
 
 twin_tail_desc: "A twin tail is a type of vertical stabilizer arrangement found on the empennage of some aircraft. Two vertical stabilizers—often smaller on their own than a single conventional tail would be—are mounted at the outside of the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer. This arrangement is also known as an H-tail. The biggest advantages of this arrangement are the larger rudder area, and an easier installation of a rear gunner position."
 twin_boom_desc: "A twin-boom aircraft has two longitudinal auxiliary booms. These may contain ancillary items such as fuel tanks and/or provide a supporting structure for other items. It has been adopted to resolve various design problems with the conventional empennage for aircraft in different roles and configurations."
 
 crescent_wing_desc: "The crescent wing is a fixed-wing aircraft configuration in which a swept wing has a greater sweep angle on the inboard section than the outboard, giving the wing a crescent shape. The planform attempts to reduce several unpleasant side-effects of the swept wing design, notably its tendency to "pitch-up", sometimes violently, when it nears a stall."
 g_suit_1_desc: "A g-suit, is a flight suit worn by aviators who are subject to high levels of acceleration force. It is designed to prevent a black-out and g-LOC (g-induced loss of consciousness) caused by the blood pooling in the lower part of the body when under acceleration, thus depriving the brain of blood."

 fuel_tanks_very_large_desc: "As airframes get bigger, we can introduce even larger fuel tanks in our designs. Bombers can now theoretically trully achieve transoceanic and transcontinental operational ranges."
 canard_desc: "A canard is a wing configuration in which a small forewing or foreplane is placed forward of the main wing of a fixed-wing aircraft. The aerodynamics of the canard configuration are complex: while it is employed to increase the aircraft's maneuverability, especially at high angles of attack or during a stall, it causes problems in the longitudinal equilibrium, static and dynamic stability characteristics."
 afterburner_desc: "An afterburner is an additional combustion component used on some jet engines. Its purpose is to increase thrust, usually for supersonic flight, takeoff, and combat. The afterburning process injects additional fuel into a combustor in the jet pipe behind the turbine, "reheating" the exhaust gas. Afterburning significantly increases thrust at the cost of increased fuel consumption which limits its use to short periods."
 mach_2_afterburner_desc: "An afterburner is an additional combustion component used on some jet engines. Its purpose is to increase thrust, usually for supersonic flight, takeoff, and combat. The afterburning process injects additional fuel into a combustor in the jet pipe behind the turbine, "reheating" the exhaust gas. Afterburning significantly increases thrust at the cost of increased fuel consumption which limits its use to short periods."
 compressor_bleed_afterburner_desc: "This type of engine incorporated a unique compressor bleed bypass at high Mach number. When opened, bypass valves bled air and routed it around the compressor rear stages, combustor, and turbine. The bleed air re-entered the turbine exhaust around the front of the afterburner where it was used for increased thrust and cooling. For extreme high-altitude and high-speed environment operation, the engine required special fuel and oil."

When opened, bypass valves bled air and routed it around the compressor rear stages, combustor, and turbine. The bleed air re-entered the turbine exhaust around the front of the afterburner where it was used for increased thrust and cooling. For extreme high-altitude and high-speed environment operation, the engine required special fuel and oil."
 
 air_improved_construction_desc: "With the developments in jet engines, aircraft construction must adapt to address stability and aerodynamic issues that have arisen as airplanes inch closer to supersonic speeds."
 air_advanced_construction_desc: "Specific research is required to successfully operate at transonic speeds and break the sound barrier. The engineering necessary to ensure that airframes can sustain the forces involved in supersonic maneuvering is not trivial."
 air_modern_construction_desc: "New materials and advanced engineering techniques can unlock more complex airframe configurations. The new generation of aircraft can be more specialized, being built to achieve specific performance targets, pushing the boundaries of flight envelopes all around."
 
 turboprops_desc: "We might have reached the pinnacle of piston engine construction. It is highly unlikely that more performance can be squeezed out of this type of technology."
 jet_engines_2_desc: "The first jet engines were fragile, unrealiable and left a lot of performance on the table. After this initial experience, we can adjust our designs solve those initial growing pains."
 second_gen_jet_engines_desc: "A new generation of jet engines must be able to operate at transonic and supersonic speeds. Without a powerful engine, that works, equipped with afterburners we can't even dream of breaking the sound barrier."
 third_gen_jet_engines_desc: "New materials and advanced engineering techniques allows for extremely powerful engines, achieving speeds in excess of Mach 2."

 plastics_1_desc: "Fully synthetic plastics have been researched in the previous decades, revolutionizing the chemical industry and opening new and exciting applications. Different types of polymers, ever cheaper, are starting to be introduced to the mass consumer market and can revolutionize, among other things, the food industry by extending the shelf life of perishable goods."
 plastics_2_desc: "The popularization of plastics led to the opening of a dedicated field of science to study, research and discover materials. Materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material (processing) influences its structure, and thus the material's properties and performance."
 plastics_3_desc: "New materials are starting to be integrated into the industrial production chain. Materials like polypropylene and polystyrene, with multiple applications will soon be so ubiquitous that one would hardly remember a world without them."
 plastics_4_desc: "Material sciences can be expanded to include every class of materials, including ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, magnetic materials, etc. With a deeper understanding of the physical, chemical and molecular properties at play, scientists can now focus on developing materials based on the properties they want to achieve."
 
 agriculture_1_desc: "Agricultural mechanization is the use of machinery and equipment, ranging from simple and basic hand tools to more sophisticated, motorized equipment and machinery, to perform agricultural operations."
 agriculture_2_desc: "The application of specialized chemicals for agricultural production can greatly increase crop yields. They can come in the form of  biocides (insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and nematicides), to protect crops, or advanced chemical fertilizers to improve crop nutrition."
 agriculture_3_desc: "Developments in the auto industry has led to a new generation of agricultural tractors and machinery. They are faster, more reliable, more efficient and cheaper."
 agriculture_4_desc: "Recent discoveries in agriculture allows farmers to improve their crop selection. Achieving more efficient production all around the year."
 agriculture_5_desc: "Agrochemicals are ever evolving. Pesticides need to cover new and changed pests, while reducing their toxicity to workers and consumers. Synthetic fertilizers are also more specialized, being able to address specific soil nutrition deficiencies."
 agriculture_6_desc: "Agriculture has achieved massive yields with the application of the latest developments in the field. This means that new ways to deal with those yields are necessary: from logistics, supply chain, business practices and large-scale investments, adaptations need to be made to address the volume of goods produced."
 
 health_1_desc: "In the early 20th century, military forces finally recognized the need to have permanent combat medics and health facilities integrated into their structure. Albeit still unsophisticated, militaries are now beginning to issue standard medical supplies to its combat units."
 health_2_desc: "Advanced antibiotics are greatly expanding the chances of the human body resisting to infections and preventing sepsis. In combat, those new drugs can be the difference of life or death."
 health_3_desc: "During the late 1930s and early 1940s, military maneuvers increased worldwide, and sexual hygiene and conduct became major problems for the troops. Efforts to raise awareness about the dangers faced by servicemen through poor sexual hygiene can make a notable difference in non-combat-related casualties."

 # SOV_guided_missile_equipment_1_desc: "The MKB Raduga FKR-1 Meteor was a land based version of the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-to-surface missile. It was a nuclear capable mobile launching system designed for ground combat. The missile had a 150km range and could be launched directly from its transporter."
 # SOV_guided_missile_equipment_2_desc: "The R-11 originated as Theme N-2 of the R-3 IRBM project. This was an alternate approach to delivering nuclear warheads on West European targets - a road-mobile missile of shorter range that could be set up at the forward area of the battlefield and reach enemy targets. The specification was for a missile of the range and payload of the German V-2, but of less than half the size, using non-cryogenic propellants."
 # SOV_guided_missile_equipment_3_desc: "The R-2 was a russian intermediate range ballistic missile. The Soviet R-2 ballistic missile was developed in 1947-1953, nearly in parallel with the R-1 from which it derived. It incorporated many detailed improvements, had double the range of the R-1 and V-2. First operational units received its missiles starting in 1953."
 # SOV_guided_missile_equipment_4_desc: "The R-5 was the first Soviet missile to be armed with a nuclear warhead. It was also the end of the road in being the ultimate extrapolation of German V-2 technology. Later missiles of both Yangel and Korolev would use other propellants and engine designs. The R-5 could deliver a 1425 kg warhead over a range of 1200 km, doubling the performance of the R-2. Following a demonstration on 20 May 1954 the system was accepted by the military in 1955."
 # SOV_guided_missile_equipment_5_desc: "The R-12 was the first operationally effective intermediate range ballistic missile, the first Soviet missile deployed with a thermonuclear warhead, and the first mass-produced missile in history. 2,300 of the storable propellant rockets were built and deployed in both mobile and silo-based versions for thirty years, from March 1959 to June 1989."
 # SOV_guided_missile_equipment_6_desc: "The R-7 was the world's first ICBM and first orbital launch vehicle. The research project was authorized in a decree of 4 December 1950. The study was headed by Korolev's NII-88 and test flights of the first lot of 12 prototype missiles was completed on January 30, 1958, and the Semyorka reached initial operational capability in 1959."
 
 # USA_guided_missile_equipment_1_desc: "In 1943, following the appearance of the Fieseler Fi 103 V-1 bomb in Europe, the US started their own program to create their own “jet bomb. Development eventually led to the JB-10 prototype in 1945, equipped with a pulsejet propulsion system. It competed with the Ford JB-2, a copy of the V-1, which was much cheaper, leading to the JB-10’s cancellation in 1946. Neither system was adopted operationally, although the JB-2 had an extended life as a test and development vehicle."
 # USA_guided_missile_equipment_2_desc: "Project Hermes was launched in November 1944, awarding General Electric a contract for the design of a family of test vehicles and operational guided missiles. One these projects was the A-3, started in 1947, with the goal of developing a liquid-fueled rocket-powered surface-to-surface missile to carry a 450 kg (1000 lb) warhead to 240 km (150 miles) with an accuracy of 60 m (200 ft) CEP. Program was slow, with the first unsuccessful attempted flight in 1953, being terminated in 1954."
 # USA_guided_missile_equipment_3_desc: "The slow pace of the Hermes program led to a decision to develop a tactical nuclear-armed ballistic missile out of the Corporal test-vehicles, a series of Army research rockets from in 1944/45. Initial production contract was signed in 1951, first flight in 1952, and first deliveries in 1954, being the first operational guided missile of the US Army. A troubled design, the Corporal was retired from frontline units in 1962."
 # USA_guided_missile_equipment_4_desc: "The Thor was the first Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) deployed by the US armed forces. Although its military career was short, its descendants are still in use as space launch vehicles. Development began in 1954, using as many already existing components as possible to accelerate development, leading to production and testing as soon as 1956. Deployment was complete in 1960. Despite being deactivated in 1963, the missiles served as test and space launch vehicles until 1972."
 # USA_guided_missile_equipment_5_desc: "The Jupiter development began as a joint Army/Navy common missile program from in 1954. The Navy abandoned the idea, but development continued both as a missile and as a space launch vehicle. The missile was first tested in 1957, and first squadron deployed in 1961 in Turkey. This led to the Soviet decision to base its own missiles in Cuba, starting the Cuban Missile Crisis. A Jupiter C vehicle also launched the first US satellite into orbit on 1 February 1958. It was retired in 1963."
 # USA_guided_missile_equipment_6_desc: "The Atlas was the first Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) deployed by the US. Development began in 1951 by Convair but changes to the design, including to its payload and propulsion, led to testing only in 1957. The first squadron was activated in 1959 at Vandenberg AFB but it became rapidly obsolete as a missile, being completely phased out in 1965. Despite that, the Atlas is still in use today in a space launch role, with the Atlas V version having first flown as recently as 2002."

In parallel, signature-informed shaping will align planforms, will control edge diffraction, will bury engines behind S-ducted inlets, and will use blended or faceted surfaces to redirect energy away from monostatic and bistatic receivers.\n\nAt the end, we might be able to turn theory into capability after further research."
