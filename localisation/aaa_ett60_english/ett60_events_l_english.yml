 inc_res.1.t:0 "Increased Resources?"
 inc_res.1.d:0 "Would you like to have extra resources, based on Increased Resources mod? If you wish, you can also have only half of extra resources. \nThis was added to the ETT1960 mod to ensure that industrial production remain viable past the 1940s, when, normally, industry grinds to a halt for lack of resources to produce more modern equipment. The mid option is preferred to make sure that resources still remain relevant."
 inc_res.1.a:0 "I don't want any extra resources!"
 inc_res.1.a.d:0 "No extra resources will be added."
 inc_res.1.b:0 "Let me have them, but not too much."
 inc_res.1.b.d:0 "Half of the resources will be added."
 inc_res.1.c:0 "Give me all you got!"
 inc_res.1.c.d:0 "All of the resources will be added."

 shackles.1.t:0 "AI Shackles"
 shackles.1.d:0 "By extending the timeline of the game into the 1960s, the ETT1960 mod also extends the issue of the minor AI nations building copious amounts of military equipment and training huge armies. This is a problem by the end of the 1940s and even more so into the 1950s and 1960s, which have a significant impact in the game performance. ETT1960 adds production and recruitment limitations to those minor countries in order to ensure a playable game. Some countries, like Brazil and Argentina, which had a reasonable industry but did not much care for conflicts abroad (until, in the case of Brazil for example, they were dragged into it) will have a limitation on recruitable manpower only, while others (like El Salvador), will have both manpower and industry capped. \n\nIf you decided to impose these limitations called shackles on the AI, it can be removed via a decision (costs no pp) if you want to play with a minor nation. Nations that have shackles and are being justified against, or at war, will immediately loose their shackles and revert to normal mobilization and economic laws. Or you can play without them from the beginning, for all countries, but it will most certainly adversely impact the game performance. Its your choice.\n\nI invite you to check the Extended Tech Tree 1960 mod on Steam to continue playing way past the normal end date with new content."

 ett60.1.d:0 "Welcome to the Extended Tech Tree 1960 mod. While I have been helped along the way, this is largely a one-member team effort, therefore I'd appreciate that if you encounter any bugs or problems, please let me know. You can reach me directly via our Discord server (link in Steam description).\nDo you need tutorial events for mod specific mechanics?"
 ett60.1.a:0 "Yes, give me the tutorials."
 ett60.1.b:0 "No, I'm a veteran."
 
 ett60tech.1.t: "Inflight Refueling Tutorial"
 ett60tech.1.d: "Inflight refueling works. However, it requires some input from the player as to configure the squadrons correctly. In order to have your refueling aircraft correctly assigned to their squadrons, the player must create a plane that has the same airframe type, role and missions as the combat aircraft in a Squadron.\nIn other words, if you want to add a refueling aircraft to a small airframe squadron, you must create your refueling aircraft using the small airframe version of the refueling airframe.\nJust so the tanker aircraft can successfully join the squadrons it must have an exact match in the “available missions” and role. Use the modules in the weapon slots to create an EXACT MATCH to the aircraft in the squadron.\nIf you’ve done it correctly the refueling aircraft will automatically join your squadrons.\nIt might be hard to make sure that your squadrons are being automatically reinforced with the correct airplanes, so I suggest you periodically keep an eye on them."

 ett60tech.2.t: "Fleet Oiler and Submarine Tankers Tutorial"
 ett60tech.2.d: "Fleet oilers extend your fleets range in a very logical and straightforward way: task force range is calculated as an average of the total range of individual ships in the TF. Fleet oilers have massive ranges in itself, and they'll assist in increasing the average task force range of the TFs they're a part of. As fleet sizes increase, there's less fuel from the oiler to pass around the fleet, so the overall range bonus from the FO decreases. In other words: the bigger the fleet, more FOs you'll need to increase its range.\nBut be careful! Fleet oilers are slow and defenseless, and they can be a liability in a battle retreat.\nThe same logic applies to Submarine Tankers. This system can be as a military, on map, couterpart to the civilian, convoy-based, Underway Replenishment system."
